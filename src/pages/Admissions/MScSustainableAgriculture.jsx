                                             The MSc Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security programme has been selected specifically to address the sustainability requirements in Uzbekistan’s Agriculture Development Strategy.  While supporting the transition of agriculture towards sustainable production systems is a global priority, the needs are acute in Uzbekistan and Middle Asia due to the increasingly extreme environmental conditions being accelerated by climate change.

                                             Developments in our understanding of how to farm sustainably through embracing the complexity of integrated systems offer many opportunities to improve both environmental and food security in Uzbekistan and across the region. Students completing this programme will thus gain a comprehensive appreciation of the wide range of new and innovative approaches to sustainable farming systems that combine crops and livestock with active management of the natural environment. In addition to the subject-specific material, all Masters students will have the opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship and business management.

                                             The programme attracts students from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and ages. The diversity of the participants is an important dynamic in this programme and plays a key role in discussing and addressing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) related to food and farming. This diversity encourages new and alternative ways of rethinking agricultural and food systems, improving livelihoods and protecting the environment. Students within the programme learn key competencies that are relevant to public administration, international development/funding agencies, research and business sectors.

This will be enhanced by access to practical knowledge and commercial expertise acquired through contact with farm managers, organisations, employers and entrepreneurs.

                                             This degree programme has been established in response to the Uzbekistan Government’s recognition of skills shortages in sustainable agriculture and food security, focussing on new knowledge about sustainable production systems and new approaches to addressing food justice and security. This will be of particular relevance to many agri-food professionals seeking to improve their skills and qualifications. A part-time route will be offered to meet the needs of these candidates.

                                             The degree will also be of interest to recent graduates in agriculture and agri-business who want to improve their knowledge and career potential. Graduates of this programme will have a wide range of career opportunities within agri-business, agri-environment, agriculture and food policy and production. This programme educates and trains professionals of the future with the specific skills required to gain access to these careers. This programme will be particularly attractive to students who wish to pursue a specialist career (e.g., as an organic or regenerative farmer or technical adviser).

                                             Studying sustainable agriculture and food security also develops the skills needed for other advanced careers in associated areas such as accountancy, land administration, law and the media. Alternatively, students may qualify for progression to postgraduate research either at the IAU or RAU or elsewhere.

                                             Graduates are likely to enter production, policy, and research and consultancy careers in the agricultural and food quality sector, within:
