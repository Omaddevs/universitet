                                             The MSc Agri-Business Management programme has been selected because, although the agri-food sector is a key strategic industry in Uzbekistan, it is one in which there has been very little development of higher level and postgraduate skills, particularly in the wider field of agri-business. This is particularly the case with respect to entrepreneurship and business innovation. With the development of new agricultural clusters, there is now a clearer and more structured process for identifying education and training needs, with the current emphasis very much on entrepreneurship, business development, sustainability, technology, innovation and food security.

                                             A recent report by the USAID Agribusiness Development Program identified that there are currently no Level 7 programmes in Agri-Business Management available in Uzbekistan, despite the growing demand for these higher-level skills. IAU has thus been encouraged by USAID to develop a specialist MSc Agri-Business Management programme, with support and advice on programme development and marketing offered through Missouri State and Texas A&M Universities, which are partners in the USAID Agribusiness program.

                                             Although this programme will be taught at the International Agriculture University (IAU), Tashkent, it will be subject to the University’s rigorous quality assurance procedures which involve subject specialists and internal peer review of the course at periodic intervals, normally of 6 years. This process ensures that the programme engages with the applicable national Subject Benchmarks and references the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications.

This will be enhanced by access to practical knowledge and commercial expertise acquired through contact with farm managers, organisations, employers and entrepreneurs.<br></br>

                                             This degree programme has been established in response to the Uzbekistan Government’s recognition of skills shortages in agri-business skills, as highlighted by the recent report from the USAID Agribusiness Program. This will be of particular relevance to many agri-food professionals seeking to improve their skills and qualifications. A part-time route will be offered to meet the needs of these candidates.<br></br>

                                             The degree will also be of interest to recent graduates in agriculture and in general business management who want to improve their knowledge and career potential. The degree will therefore open a range of career opportunities on a local, national and international level. Graduates have a wide range of career opportunities within the agri-food business sector, from food production through processing, marketing, distribution and sales.<br></br>

                                             This programme will educate and train the entrepreneurs and business professionals of the future with the specific skills required to gain access to these careers. Alternatively, students may qualify for progression to postgraduate research either at the IAU or RAU or elsewhere.<br></br>
